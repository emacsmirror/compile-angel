The **compile-angel** package automatically byte-compiles and native-compiles Emacs Lisp libraries. It offers two global minor modes:
- `(compile-angel-on-save-mode)`: Compiles when an .el file is modified and saved.
- `(compile-angel-on-load-mode)`: Compiles an .el file before it is loaded.

These modes ensure that Emacs always has up-to-date byte-compiled and native-compiled files.

This package is an alternative to the auto-compile Emacs package. Here are the main differences:
- The compile-angel package is lightweight, with one-third the lines of code of auto-compile.
- The compile-angel package, in addition to compiling the elisp files that are loaded using `load` and `require`, also handles files that auto-compile misses, such as those that are deferred (e.g., with `:defer t` and `use-package`) or `autoload`.

*(Special thanks to Jonas Bernoulli, the creator of the auto-compile package, whose work inspired the development of compile-angel. This package was created to offer a lightweight alternative to auto-compile that also compiles deferred/autoloaded .el files.)*

NOTE: It is recommended to set `load-prefer-newer` to `t` to ensure that Emacs loads the most recent version of byte-compiled or source files.
